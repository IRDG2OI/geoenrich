# Package description

GeoEnrich provides functionalities to enrich georeferenced events (such as species occurrences) with environmental data from satellites or models. Users can specify a geographic or temporal buffer to include data in the neighbourhood of occurrences into their analyses.

This package is intended for large numbers of occurrences: local storage is implemented to avoid redundant requests to remote servers. All downloaded environmental data are stored locally in netCDF files and can be retrieved as a summary csv file, multidimensional numpy arrays, or exported as png images.

Sea surface temperature, chlorophyll, and 40 other environmental variables are available natively, and others can easily be added by the user.

The package provides functions to retrieve occurrence data directly from GBIF, or open a custom dataset from any source. Arbitrary areas defined by the user can also be enriched.

This project is being developed as part of the G2OI project, cofinanced by the European union, the Reunion region, and the French Republic.

## Installation

Installation instructions are in the documentation, for [python](https://geoenrich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) and [R](https://geoenrich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/r-install.html).

## Using the plugin

Jupyter Notebook tutorials are available for [python](https://geoenrich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html) and [R](https://geoenrich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/r-tutorial.html).

## Issues and further developments

### User suggestions

Please feel free to raise issues or suggest improvements in the [Issues tab](https://github.com/morand-g/geoenrich/issues).

### Planned improvements

#### Depth requests

There are currently only two options regarding the depth dimension: only surface data, or data for all depths.
We plan to add an option to download data for any range of depth.

#### Data export formats

There is a plan to add export options for enrichment data: netCDF files (per occurrence or per dataset).
