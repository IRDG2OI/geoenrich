Installation instructions for R
===============================


1. Prerequisites
----------------

Assuming you have a version of R installed on your computer, as well as Python3 and pip. This is automatic in all recent Linux distributions. Otherwise instructions are available here: `Python <https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download>`_ and `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/>`_.


2. Installation
---------------

First some python packages need to be installed. This can be done directly in R::

	system("python3 -m pip install matplotlib appdirs geojson_rewind geomet requests_cache wheel")

	system("python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/rvanasa/pygbif.git")

.. note::
	pygbif needs to be installed from GitHub because the version on PyPI is not up to date. If you have an error message saying that you don't have git installed on your computer, you can either install it or download the whole repository from github in a browser.

Installation of geoenrich is then done in the classic way::

	system("python3 -m pip install geoenrich")

Then the reticulate library is used to load the python package into R::

	install.packages("reticulate")
	library(reticulate)

Finally, all submodules can be imported::

	dataloader <- import("geoenrich.dataloader")
	satellite <- import("geoenrich.satellite")
	enrichment <- import("geoenrich.enrichment")
	exports <- import("geoenrich.exports")


3. Configuration
----------------

3.1. First configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first time you import one of the modules, it will display the location of the *credentials_example.py* configuration file. You will need to edit it and then remove *_example* from the file name so its name is just *credentials.py*.

In this file, you need to specify the *root_path* where all persistent data will be stored. You should pick a stable location with plenty of free space available (depending on your data download needs).

If you want to use services that require authentification, you need to specify your credentials there.
You will see 3 variables that need to be filled with GBIF credentials if you want to download occurrence data from GBIF. If you don't already have an account you can register on the `GBIF website <https://www.gbif.org/user/profile/>`_.

There is also a dictionary named *dap_creds* that is intended to store credentials to OpenDAP servers. The server domains are the keys, like the example provided for Copernicus. You can add as many credentials as you need into that dictionary.

3.2. Adding other data sources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At the same location, there is a *catalog.csv* file that already contains a list of available variables. If you want to use a dataset from Copernicus, you first need to register on `their website <https://resources.marine.copernicus.eu/registration-form>`_ and write your credentials in the *credentials.py* file.

If you need additional variables, you can update the *catalog.csv* file to add other opendap servers. Three columns are compulsory:

- *variable*: A unique name for that variable (user defined).
- *url*: OpenDAP URL.
- *varname*: Name of the variable in the remote dataset.


5. Precautions
--------------

If you edited the *catalog.csv* file to add variables, you should make a backup of it, as it will get overwritten if you update or reinstall this package.
